5. Dr. Lovelace reveals that her memory integration technology has been corrupted for advertising
6. She gives the player a Neural Firewall and asks them to investigate Quantum Dynamics

**Humor Elements**:

  - "BURLAP UNDERWEAR! FEEL THE SCRATCH THAT MEANS IT'S WORKING!"
  - "LIQUID COURAGE! IT'S LIKE REGULAR COURAGE BUT WET AND PROBABLY FLAMMABLE!"

**Location**: NeuraTech Facility (Map106) → Quantum Dynamics Facility (Map110)

**Quest Overview**:
The memory manipulation technology was just a test for a larger corporate scheme - the five MegaCorps are working on a "Corporate Crossover" project to merge their technologies. The player must infiltrate Quantum Dynamics to sabotage the project before it creates a catastrophic reality glitch that could merge all corporate facilities into one nightmarish mega-structure.
