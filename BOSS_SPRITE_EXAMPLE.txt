# MegaEarth2049 Boss Sprite Sheet Example

This file provides an ASCII art representation of how a boss sprite sheet should be structured. This is meant as a conceptual guide to help visualize the layout and animation frames described in the BOSS_ART_CREATION_GUIDE.md.

## Example: Punk Boss (punkBoss1_animated)

Below is a simplified ASCII representation of how the sprite sheet for the Punk Boss might be organized. Each character represents a pixel block, and the actual sprite would be 96x96 pixels per frame.

## Actual Pixel Art Implementation

In the actual pixel art implementation:

1. Each frame would be 96x96 pixels
2. The entire sprite sheet would be 768x384 pixels (8 frames × 96 pixels wide, 4 animation types × 96 pixels tall)
3. The punk boss would have:
   - Tall, colorful mohawk
   - Spiked leather jacket
   - Cybernetic arm enhancements
   - Chains and other punk accessories
   - Threatening posture

## Key Visual Elements to Include

For the Punk Boss specifically:

1. **Mohawk**: Tall, multicolored (green, pink, blue) with exaggerated height
2. **Cybernetics**: Glowing arm or eye enhancements that flash or spark when near death
3. **Leather Jacket**: Covered in spikes, studs, and possibly a gang logo
4. **Chains**: Hanging from belt or jacket for dynamic movement during animations
5. **Boots**: Heavy with metal plating or spikes
6. **Expression**: Menacing, possibly with a scar or cybernetic eye

## Animation Details

### Idle Animation
- Subtle shifting of weight from one foot to another
- Slight movement of the mohawk
- Occasional glint or pulse from cybernetic parts
- Chains swaying slightly

### Attack Animation
- Wind-up: Pulling back cybernetic arm, which begins to glow
- Execution: Powerful forward punch or swing of a weapon
- Impact: Energy burst or impact effect at the end of the attack
- Recovery: Return to idle stance with residual energy effects

### Damage Reaction
- Impact: Head jerking back, eyes widening
- Recoil: Staggering slightly but maintaining imposing presence
- Recovery: Straightening up with an angry expression

### Near-Death State
- Red tint over the entire sprite
- Cybernetic parts sparking or malfunctioning
- Possibly more hunched posture
- Damaged appearance but still threatening

## Technical Notes

1. The actual sprite sheet would use a limited color palette (12-20 colors)
2. Each animation frame would have clear silhouettes
3. The near-death frames would use the same poses as the idle animation but with red tint and additional damage effects
4. Special effects like glowing cybernetics would use brighter colors against the darker base
5. The sprite would maintain a consistent light source direction

This ASCII representation is simplified - the actual pixel art would have much more detail and nuance in the animations and visual elements.
