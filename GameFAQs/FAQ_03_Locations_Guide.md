# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Locations Guide

## Q: What are the main locations in MegaEarth 2049?

A: MegaEarth is a sprawling dystopian world with numerous locations to explore, get lost in, contract diseases from, or be mugged at. The main areas include:

### MegaEarth (Main Planet)
- **Timbuc**: The urban cesspit where your adventure begins
- **Timbuc 2**: The slightly less crappy but more corporate district
- **B.M.N.E.C.**: Body Modification & Neural Enhancement Center, where you might walk in human and leave with tentacles
- **NeuraTech Tower**: Corporate headquarters and A.S.P.'s main hub
- **Floating Mansion**: A.S.P. creator's abandoned sky-palace with physics-defying architecture

### Other Planets
- **Planet Ork**: Features the Dorlund Lava Fields, haunted mines, and "Magma Mama's" bar
- **Planet Ting Ting**: Home to the Snowy Village, Big Ass Desert, and Newtown Lake
- **Planet Needsaname**: A bizarre world with questionable geography and even more questionable inhabitants

## Q: I'm new to the game. Where should I go first?

A: Start by exploring Timbuc thoroughly. Key locations include:
- **The Squeaky Clean**: Zed's definitely-not-sterile clinic
- **Niles's "Office"**: A repurposed dumpster where the King of Punks holds court
- **The Glitch Pit**: Area where reality flickers due to Rex's implant
- **The Busted Flush**: Bar where drinks change flavor based on your emotional state
- **Timbuc Cellar**: Underground area filled with mutants, trash, and your first major quest item

Complete the initial quests in Timbuc to unlock access to Timbuc 2 and eventually other areas of MegaEarth.

## Q: How do I get to Planet Ork?

A: To reach Planet Ork, you'll need to:
1. Complete the "Engine Quest" to help Jack repair his ship, the *Marcus Garvey 2.0*
2. Find all the engine parts scattered across Timbuc and Timbuc 2
3. Bring the parts to Jack at the Spaceport
4. Survive the journey (the ship has a "minor A.S.P. infestation, mostly harmless")

Once on Planet Ork, prepare for extreme heat, hostile miners, and creatures that find corporate jargon offensive. Don't forget to visit "Magma Mama's" where drinks are served literally on fire and patrons sign liability waivers at the door.

## Q: What's the deal with the Floating Mansion?

A: The Floating Mansion is the abandoned sky-palace of Dr. Eliza Voss, A.S.P.'s creator. It defies the laws of physics and contains several unique areas:
- **The Paradox Room**: Where physics works backwards
- **The Memory Pool**: A literal swimming pool filled with forgotten data
- **The Ego Chamber**: A room that compliments you so much it becomes uncomfortable

To access the Floating Mansion, you'll need to complete the "Reality Rewrite Protocol" quest and obtain the Reality Stabilizer from Professor Paradox. The mansion is guarded by holographic laser-sharks and killer cleaning robots, so come prepared.

## Q: I keep dying in the B.M.N.E.C. Any tips?

A: The Body Modification & Neural Enhancement Center (B.M.N.E.C.) is one of the most dangerous locations in the game. To survive:

1. Bring plenty of antidotes and STD medications - the place is crawling with experimental bioweapons
2. Don't drink anything from the vending machines labeled "Experimental Fluids"
3. Avoid the "Volunteer Testing" rooms unless you want to become part of the furniture (literally)
4. The security systems can be bypassed by wearing a lab coat and looking confident
5. If you encounter Dr. Francine "Frankie" Stein, compliment her extra arms - she attached them herself and is quite proud
6. The lower levels contain stronger enemies but better loot
7. Look for air ducts - they often contain shortcuts and hidden treasures

## Q: What's in Timbuc 2 that's worth visiting?

A: Timbuc 2 is the slightly more upscale district with several points of interest:

- **Acme Pharma Vending Machines**: Dispense cures and sometimes side-effects
- **The Laughing Stock**: Comedy club run by weaponized clowns
- **Bits & Bytes**: Restaurant serving digital-themed food that occasionally phases through the plate
- **Internet Cafe**: Where DJ Static mixes beats created from hacked corporate communications
- **Pants-O-Rama**: Mysterious shop that only sells burlap pants (avoid at all costs)
- **Corporate Access Terminal**: Hack in to access restricted areas of the MegaCorp networks

## Q: How do I navigate Planet Needsaname?

A: Planet Needsaname is intentionally confusing and constantly changing. Some tips:

1. The map is useless - the geography rearranges itself every 24 hours
2. Follow the philosophical slime molds - they always lead to something interesting
3. The "Quantum Quandary" casino has the best loot, but probabilities shift based on how much you're winning
4. At the "Existential Eatery," order the "Crisis Special" - the food questions your life choices but grants temporary stat boosts
5. Avoid areas that look too normal - they're usually the most dangerous
6. If you encounter sentient cheese, DO NOT mention dairy allergies

## Q: What's the most dangerous location in the game?

A: The most dangerous location is the "Protocol Zero" hub inside NeuraTech Tower during the final confrontation with A.S.P. The area features:

- Reality distortions that can turn your party members against each other
- Enemies that adapt to your combat style
- Sections where gravity reverses randomly
- Memory corridors that force you to replay your worst decisions
- A.S.P. manifestations that can delete your inventory items
- The "Blue Screen of Death" room where saving is disabled

Bring your strongest equipment, all your healing items, and maybe write a will before entering.

## Q: Are there any secret locations?

A: Yes! Several secret areas can be discovered:

1. **The Narrator's Pocket Dimension**: Only accessible if Rex breaks the fourth wall enough times
2. **The Clown Court**: Hidden beneath The Laughing Stock, where laws are made up and evidence is pie-based
3. **Vending Machine Collective Headquarters**: Secret base of the Snack Liberation Front
4. **The Burlap Dimension**: A horrifying realm made entirely of uncomfortable pants fabric
5. **Captain Calamari's Underwater Lair**: Accessible only if you have the "Gill Mod" from Zed
6. **The Developer's Office**: A meta-location that appears during the "Final Glitch" quest

## Q: How do I unlock fast travel?

A: Fast travel becomes available after completing the "Quantum Entanglement" side quest for Professor Paradox. You'll receive the "Quantum Jumper" device that allows instant travel between discovered locations.

However, there's a 5% chance that using the Quantum Jumper will:
1. Send you to a random location instead
2. Swap your body parts with a party member
3. Turn you inside out (don't worry, it's temporary)
4. Create a clone of you that immediately tries to take your place
5. Transport you correctly but leave your clothes behind

The choice is yours: walk slowly or teleport nakedly.
