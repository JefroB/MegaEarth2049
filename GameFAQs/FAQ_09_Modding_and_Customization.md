## Q: Can I mod MegaEarth 2049?

A: Absolutely! MegaEarth 2049 was built with modding in mind, and the developers actively encourage players to create and share mods. The game uses a modified version of RPG Maker MV, making it relatively accessible for modding.

The developers have stated, "If you think our game is weird, we can't wait to see what twisted creations the community comes up with!" This has led to a thriving modding community that has created everything from simple texture replacements to entirely new questlines and gameplay mechanics.

## Q: How do I install mods?

A: Installing mods for MegaEarth 2049 is relatively straightforward:

1. **Manual Installation**:
   - Download the mod files

   - Launch the game and enable the mod in the Mod Manager (accessible from the main menu)

2. **Using the Mod Manager**:

## Q: How do I create my own mods?

A: Creating mods for MegaEarth 2049 can range from simple to complex, depending on what you want to achieve:

1. **Basic Modding Tools**:
   - **MegaEarth Mod Kit**: Download from the official website. Includes documentation and basic tools.
   - **RPG Maker MV**: Since the game is built on a modified version of RPG Maker MV, familiarity with this engine is helpful.
   - **MegaEarth Script Extender (MESE)**: Required for more advanced mods that add new functionality.

2. **Getting Started**:
   - Begin with the official tutorials in the Mod Kit
   - Join the MegaEarth Modding Discord for community support
   - Start small by modifying existing content before creating new content

3. **Types of Mods You Can Create**:
   - **Texture Replacements**: Change how items, characters, or environments look
   - **New Items/Equipment**: Add new weapons, armor, or consumables
   - **New Quests**: Create additional storylines and missions
   - **New Areas**: Design new locations to explore
   - **Gameplay Overhauls**: Modify core game mechanics
   - **New STDs**: The community favorite - create new status effects disguised as diseases

4. **Publishing Your Mod**:
   - Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility with the base game
   - Create a detailed description and installation instructions
   - Upload to NexusMods, Steam Workshop, or the official MegaEarth Mod Repository
   - Consider compatibility patches for popular mods

The developers have created a surprisingly robust modding API, allowing for significant changes to the game. They regularly feature community mods on their social media and have even incorporated some mod ideas into official updates.

## Q: Are there any restrictions on modding?

A: While the developers encourage modding, there are some guidelines and restrictions:

1. **Legal Restrictions**:
   - Don't distribute the base game's assets
   - Don't use copyrighted material from other games/media without permission
   - Don't create mods that bypass DRM or enable piracy

2. **Content Guidelines** (for official mod repositories):
   - No malicious code or spyware
   - NSFW content must be clearly labeled
   - Mods that are purely offensive without humor or purpose may be removed
   - No stealing other modders' work without permission

3. **Technical Limitations**:
   - The game engine has memory limitations
   - Some core systems are hardcoded and difficult to modify
   - Extensive script modifications may break with game updates

4. **The "Burlap Rule"**:
   - A unique guideline from the developers: "All mods must acknowledge the superiority of burlap in some way." This is obviously a joke, but many modders include a token burlap item as tradition.

The developers have stated they won't take action against mods unless they violate legal requirements or contain malicious code. They've even embraced some of the more bizarre mods, featuring them in developer livestreams.

## Q: Will mods disable achievements?

A: The developers have taken a nuanced approach to mods and achievements:

1. **Cosmetic Mods**: Texture replacements, UI modifications, and audio changes do not disable achievements.

2. **Content Addition Mods**: Mods that add new items, quests, or areas without modifying core gameplay generally do not disable achievements.

3. **Gameplay Modification Mods**: Mods that alter core mechanics, change difficulty, or add cheats will disable achievements.

4. **The Achievement Manager**: The game includes an "Achievement Integrity System" that evaluates mods and determines if they should disable achievements. You can view this in the Mod Manager to see which of your installed mods affect achievement eligibility.

5. **The "Modder's Pride" Achievement**: Ironically, there's an achievement called "Modder's Pride" that you can only unlock by creating and installing your own mod. This is the developers' way of encouraging the community to try modding.

6. **The Burlap Exception**: In a typical MegaEarth 2049 quirk, any mod that adds more burlap-themed content will never disable achievements, regardless of how much it changes gameplay. The developers really have a thing for burlap.

The developers have expressed delight at some of the community's story modifications, particularly praising mods that expand on minor characters or explore alternative perspectives on the main plot.

## Q: Are there any multiplayer mods?

A: Preserving your carefully curated mod setup is important, especially before game updates:

   - The "Export Mod Profile" feature saves your mod list and load order
   - Create different profiles for different playthroughs
   - The manager can automatically back up profiles

2. **Manual Backups**:
   - Copy your entire /mods/ folder to a safe location
   - Save the mod configuration files from [User Directory]/AppData/Local/MegaEarth2049/ModConfig/
   - Archive downloaded mod files separately from installed mods

3. **Before Updates**:
   - Always back up before a game update
   - Check the update notes for changes that might affect mods
