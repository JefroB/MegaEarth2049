# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Body Modification System

## Q: What are body modifications in MegaEarth 2049?

A: In the harsh world of MegaEarth 2049, body modifications (or "mods") are far more than cosmetic enhancementsâ€”they're often necessary survival adaptations. Unlike the clean, corporate-approved cybernetics of the elite, most wasteland dwellers rely on back-alley mod doctors using salvaged parts, experimental biotech, and questionable medical practices.

Body modifications in MegaEarth 2049 range from simple mechanical limb replacements to complex neural implants, from cosmetic alterations to radical biological enhancements. They're characterized by their jury-rigged nature, unpredictable side effects, and the distinct possibility that they might malfunction at the worst possible moment.

## Q: Why would I want to get modified?

A: There are several compelling reasons to risk a visit to a mod doctor:

1. **Combat Advantages**: Many mods provide significant combat benefits, such as increased strength, built-in weapons, or enhanced reflexes.

2. **Environmental Adaptation**: Specialized mods can help you survive harsh environments, like radiation zones, toxic areas, or extreme temperatures.

3. **Utility Functions**: Some mods provide practical benefits like built-in lockpicks, hidden storage compartments, or enhanced sensory capabilities.

4. **Disease Resistance**: Certain biological mods can provide immunity to the many diseases plaguing MegaEarth.

5. **Stat Boosts**: Most mods provide permanent stat increases, though often with trade-offs.

6. **Quest Requirements**: Some quests require specific modifications to complete.

7. **Social Status**: In certain communities, modifications are seen as marks of prestige or group affiliation.

## Q: Who is Zed and what is "The Squeaky Clean"?

A: Zed is MegaEarth's most notorious mod doctor, operating out of his clinic ironically named "The Squeaky Clean" in Timbuc. A former Vitalix biotech researcher who was fired for "excessive creativity" (corporate speak for "horrifically unethical experimentation"), Zed now offers his services to anyone with enough credits or interesting trade goods.

Zed's clinic is a paradoxical mix of cutting-edge technology and absolute squalor. Operating tables sit next to piles of salvaged parts, experimental serums bubble in beakers next to open cans of beer, and the floor is suspiciously sticky despite the name of the establishment.

What makes Zed unique is his willingness to install experimental modifications that other doctors wouldn't touch. His motto: "If it might work, it's worth trying! Refunds only available if you survive the procedure."

## Q: What types of modifications are available?

A: MegaEarth 2049 features four main categories of body modifications:

## Q: What are the risks of body modification?

A: Body modification in MegaEarth 2049 is never without risk. Potential complications include:

- **Rejection**: Your body may reject the modification, causing it to malfunction or require removal.

- **Infection**: Zed's definition of "sterile" is "wiped it down with whatever alcohol was closest."

- **Malfunction**: Modifications can glitch, short-circuit, or otherwise fail at inopportune moments.

- **Side Effects**: Unexpected and often bizarre side effects are common, especially with experimental mods.

- **Addiction**: Some users become addicted to the process of modification itself, constantly seeking more extreme changes.

- **Corporate Interest**: Highly modified individuals may attract unwanted attention from MegaCorps interested in "recovering" their technology.

- **Social Stigma**: Some communities discriminate against the heavily modified.

The risk level varies by modification type:

## Q: How do modifications affect gameplay?

A: Body modifications impact gameplay in several ways:

- **Stat Changes**: Most modifications provide permanent stat boosts and penalties.

- **New Abilities**: Many mods grant unique abilities that can be used in and out of combat.

- **Dialogue Options**: Being visibly modified opens up new dialogue options with some NPCs and closes others.

- **Environmental Interactions**: Certain mods allow you to interact with the environment in new ways, such as accessing locked areas or surviving hazardous conditions.

- **Combat Advantages**: Combat-focused mods can provide new attack options, defensive capabilities, or tactical advantages.

- **Side Effect Management**: Managing the side effects of your modifications becomes part of the gameplay experience.

- **Resource Allocation**: Deciding which modifications to get with limited resources is a key strategic choice.

## Q: Can modifications be removed or upgraded?

A: Yes, but with caveats:

- **Removal**: Most modifications can be removed, but the process is painful, expensive, and may leave permanent effects on your character. Cybernetic mods are the easiest to remove, while biological mods often leave lasting changes.

- **Upgrades**: Many modifications can be upgraded to more powerful versions if you have the credits and Zed has the necessary components. Upgrades are generally less risky than new installations since your body has already adapted to the base modification.

- **Maintenance**: Some modifications require periodic maintenance to prevent malfunction or degradation. Neglecting maintenance can lead to decreased effectiveness or dangerous glitches.

## Q: Are there different styles or brands of modifications?

A: Yes, modifications in MegaEarth 2049 come in different styles that reflect their origin:

- **Corporate**: Clean, efficient, and standardized. These mods come from MegaCorp R&D departments and are typically stolen or salvaged. They have fewer side effects but are more easily tracked by corporate security.

- **Wasteland**: Jury-rigged, creative, and unpredictable. These are unique creations made from salvaged parts and improvised materials. They're more likely to have strange side effects but offer unique advantages.

- **Military**: Durable, practical, and combat-focused. Salvaged from military personnel or bases, these modifications prioritize function over form and often include weapon systems or tactical enhancements.

- **Luxury**: Flashy, aesthetic, and status-oriented. Originally designed for the elite, these modifications emphasize appearance while still providing functional benefits. They tend to draw attention.

- **Tribal**: Organic, ritualistic, and harmony-focused. Developed by wasteland communities with limited technology, these modifications use natural materials and ancient techniques combined with modern knowledge.
