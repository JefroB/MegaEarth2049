# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Disease System

## Q: What are diseases in MegaEarth 2049?

A: Diseases in MegaEarth 2049 are special status effects that can affect both your party members and enemies. Unlike traditional RPG status effects, diseases in MegaEarth 2049 are inspired by real-world medical conditions but with an absurdist twist that fits the game's dark humor. Diseases can provide both advantages and disadvantages, making them a unique tactical element in combat.

## Q: How do I get infected with diseases?

A: There are several ways to contract diseases:
- Enemy attacks (some enemies specialize in disease transmission)
- Environmental hazards (toxic waste, radiation zones, etc.)
- Story events (certain quests may involve disease exposure)
- Items (some items have disease side effects)
- STD transmission (certain... intimate interactions may result in disease)

## Q: How do I cure diseases?

A: Most diseases can be cured using specific medications, typically manufactured by Acme Pharmaceuticals. Each disease has its own cure item that can be purchased from medical vendors or found as loot. Some diseases, however, are chronic and cannot be easily cured without special quest items or procedures.

3. **Unique Dialogue**: Each condition has its own set of humorous ridicule dialogue options

## Q: Any tips for managing diseases, ailments, and mental illnesses?

1. **Stock up on cures**: Always keep a supply of disease cures, especially before entering areas known for disease-spreading enemies.

2. **Use Protectionâ„¢**: When facing enemies known to spread STDs, use Protectionâ„¢ to prevent infection.

3. **Consider the benefits**: Some diseases provide benefits that might outweigh their drawbacks in certain situations.

4. **Quarantine Zone**: If your entire party gets infected with STDs, visit the Quarantine Zone for rare items and quests.

5. **Disease resistance**: Some equipment provides disease resistance. The "Hazmat Suit" is particularly effective.

6. **Jen's abilities**: If Jen is in your party, she can cure diseases without using items.

7. **Disease spreading**: Be aware that some diseases can spread between party members if not treated quickly.

8. **Environmental hazards**: Watch for environmental hazards that can cause diseases, such as toxic waste or radiation zones.

9. **Strategic infection**: Sometimes it's worth intentionally getting infected with certain diseases for their benefits.

10. **Technological immunity**: Characters with cybernetic enhancements are immune to certain biological diseases but more susceptible to technological ones.

11. **Minor ailment management**: Don't waste expensive cures on minor ailments unless you're tired of being ridiculed. Most minor ailments will clear up on their own after a few battles or rest periods.

12. **Social situations**: Consider curing visible minor ailments before important social encounters if you want to avoid the ridicule and small persuasion penalties.

13. **Mental illness strategy**: Unlike diseases and ailments, mental illnesses can be powerful assets if used correctly. Consider keeping beneficial ones like Autism Spectrum for puzzles or OCD for precision attacks.

14. **Medication side effects**: Mental illness medications are effective but expensive. Some also have minor side effects not listed in their descriptions - experiment to find out!

15. **Environmental factors**: Some mental illnesses like Seasonal Affective and Agoraphobia are heavily influenced by your environment. Plan accordingly.

Remember, in the wasteland of MegaEarth 2049, sometimes a little disease is just what the doctor ordered... especially if that doctor is Dr. Frankenstein.
