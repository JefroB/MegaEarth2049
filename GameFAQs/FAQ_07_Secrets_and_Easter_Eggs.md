# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Secrets and Easter Eggs

## Q: What are the best hidden secrets in MegaEarth 2049?

A: MegaEarth 2049 is packed with secrets, easter eggs, and hidden content. Here are some of the most notable discoveries:

1. **The Developer Room**: A hidden area containing NPCs based on the game's developers. Each offers unique dialogue and references to the game's creation. Located in a glitched wall in Timbuc 2's Internet Cafe.

2. **Rubber Chicken Weapon**: Initially appears to be a joke weapon, but if fully upgraded through The Twins' shop, it becomes one of the most powerful weapons in the game, complete with a special "Squawk Attack" animation.

3. **The Narrator's True Identity**: If you complete The Narrator's questline, you discover they're actually an interdimensional being who's been trapped in the game and is using Rex to escape.

4. **Secret Ending #7**: Beyond the six main endings, there's a hidden seventh ending triggered by collecting all STDs, wearing the full Burlap outfit, and defeating A.S.P. while having negative reputation with all factions. This "Chaos Reigns" ending is arguably the most absurd.

5. **Vending Machine Romance**: If you're consistently nice to the sentient vending machines throughout the game, they develop a collective crush on Rex, eventually leading to a bizarre "romance" option with unique perks.

6. **The Actual Poop Enemy**: In the sewers beneath Timbuc, there's a 1/1000 chance of encountering "The Actual Poop," a legendary enemy that drops the "Toilet Paper Roll of Destiny" accessory, which grants immunity to all bodily function status effects.

7. **Captain Calamari's Secret Identity**: If you complete his personal quest and have high enough reputation, Captain Calamari reveals he's actually from Earth and was the CEO of a failed tech startup before being experimented on by Vitalix.

8. **The Fourth Wall Break Room**: A hidden room in NeuraTech Tower where all NPCs directly address the player (not Rex) and discuss the fact that they're in a game.

9. **The Trash King's Crown**: If you collect all 50 pieces of "Valuable Trash" scattered throughout MegaEarth, you can forge the Trash King's Crown, which makes all trash-based enemies friendly.

10. **The Burlap Dimension**: If you wear the complete Burlap outfit (pants, shirt, hat, underwear, socks) and stand in the center of Pants-O-Rama at exactly midnight game time, you're transported to a horrifying dimension made entirely of burlap where everything is uncomfortable.
