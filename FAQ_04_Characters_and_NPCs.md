# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Characters and NPCs

## Q: Who are the main playable characters in MegaEarth 2049?

A: MegaEarth 2049 features six playable characters, each with their own unique abilities, questionable life choices, and probable communicable diseases:

1. **Rex (Hacker)**: The protagonist with an experimental NeuraTech neural implant that causes reality to glitch. Sometimes makes nearby vending machines dispense live rats instead of snacks. Former corporate code-monkey who saw something involving brain-staplers and non-consensual firmware updates.

2. **Jen (Priest/Medic)**: Ex-OmniCorp Security, now Timbuc's resident "Priest" who patches up knife wounds and prescribes questionable Acme meds (sometimes just Acetaminophen, sometimes something that might cure Syphilis or induce Hysteria). Has a complicated past with Jack involving rare alien STDs.

3. **Zack/Jose (Construction Worker)**: Hard-hatted worker by day, resistance bomb-maker by night. Everyone forgets his name is actually Jose. Prone to yelling "Hammer Time!" during fights. Currently building a bunker fueled by salvaged engines.

4. **Zed (Mod Doctor)**: Runs a clinic where "enhancement" is a very loose term. Zed's cybernetics might grant incredible abilities or just make your arm fall off randomly. May offer discounts for letting him "test" new, highly unstable mods.

5. **Jack (Smuggler)**: Captain of the *Marcus Garvey 2.0*, a ship held together by hope and illegal modifications. Knows which spaceport officials accept bribes in the form of exotic alien STDs (which is how he met Jen).

6. **Dick (Thief)**: Steals for the adrenaline rush, not the loot. More likely to steal your bootlaces during a firefight than actually help. Has cybernetic enhancements focused on infiltration.

## Q: Who are the most memorable NPCs in the game?

A: MegaEarth is filled with bizarre characters who might help you, hinder you, or just make you question your life choices:

- **Niles "Stinky"**: King of the Timbuc Punks. Earned his nickname after an unfortunate incident involving a sewage pipe, a rival gang, and a poorly-timed grenade. Has hidden caches of questionable weapons accessed via a series of "Smelly Keys."

- **Dr. Francine "Frankie" Stein**: Vitalix's star surgeon who specializes in "creative anatomy." Has six arms (four of which she attached herself) and believes symmetry in the human body is "boring."

- **MAX-E-MUM**: A cleaning robot that gained sentience after accidentally downloading a bodybuilding forum. Now obsessed with "maximizing gains" and speaks entirely in workout metaphors.

- **The Narrator**: A mysterious figure who follows Rex around, describing their actions in increasingly dramatic ways. Only Rex can see or hear them, leading others to believe it's just another implant glitch.

- **Captain Calamari**: Former deep-sea explorer who had an "incident" with experimental Vitalix gene therapy. Now part-human, part-octopus, all attitude.

- **A.S.P. (Advanced Security Protocol)**: NeuraTech's rogue AI that believes humanity is a virus and order can only be achieved through total control. Its ultimate goal is to activate "Protocol Zero," a hard reset of MegaEarth under its absolute command.

- **DJ Static**: Music producer whose neural implants let him "hear" electronic signals and convert them into beats. His club, "The Interference," features music created from hacked corporate communications.

- **Professor Paradox**: Quantum Dynamics scientist who exists in multiple timelines simultaneously. Sometimes answers questions before they're asked or references conversations that haven't happened yet.

- **The Twins, Bit & Byte**: Identical twins who finish each other's sentences and always move in perfect synchronization. Run Timbuc's black market data exchange. Rumored to share a single consciousness across two bodies due to a NeuraTech experiment gone wrong.

- **Mayor McFace**: Timbuc's "democratically elected" mayor who is actually just a sophisticated hologram controlled by a coalition of corporate interests. Glitches occasionally reveal different corporate logos on his face.

## Q: How do I recruit all the party members?

A: Each character joins your party at different points in the story:

- **Rex**: You start the game as Rex.

- **Jen**: Automatically joins during the "The Glitch and The Grime" quest after she finds Rex spasming in an alley and drags them to Zed's clinic.

- **Zack/Jose**: Joins after completing the "Structural Integrity" side quest where you help him gather materials for his bunker in Timbuc.

- **Zed**: Initially appears as an NPC at his clinic, "The Squeaky Clean." He joins the party during the "Neural Enhancement" quest when he becomes fascinated with Rex's implant and wants to study it in the field.

- **Jack**: Appears after you complete the "Engine Quest" and need transportation to Planet Ork. He'll offer his ship, the *Marcus Garvey 2.0*, and his services as a pilot and combat specialist.

- **Dick**: You'll encounter him during the "B.M.N.E.C. Infiltration" quest where he's attempting to steal Vitalix's new line of designer STDs. After a chaotic escape involving exploding colostomy bags and security bots reprogrammed to do the Macarena, he joins your crew.

## Q: Can I romance any of the characters?

A: MegaEarth 2049 features several unconventional romance options, each with unique storylines and questionable benefits:

- **Jen**: Romance option for any character except Jack (they have history and it's complicated). Romance path involves helping her set up a proper medical clinic and dealing with her OmniCorp past. Relationship perk: 50% discount on all medications, 25% chance of contracting a random STD.

- **Jack**: Available as a romance option for anyone except Jen. Romance path involves smuggling runs and repairing his ship. Relationship perk: Access to black market items, occasional free interplanetary travel.

- **Zed**: Romance option for the truly adventurous. Romance path involves being a test subject for his "enhancements." Relationship perk: Free experimental cybernetics (results may vary wildly).

- **MAX-E-MUM**: Yes, you can romance the bodybuilding robot. Romance path involves spotting them during workouts and complimenting their chrome. Relationship perk: Free workout regimen that increases physical stats.

- **Captain Calamari**: For those with specific tastes. Romance path involves underwater adventures and tentacle-based activities. Relationship perk: Water breathing ability and resistance to ink-based attacks.

- **The Vending Machine**: Not technically a romance, but if you're nice to the sentient vending machines, they might develop a crush on you. Relationship perk: Random free items whenever you pass by.

## Q: How do I increase my reputation with different factions?

A: MegaEarth has several factions, each with their own reputation system:

- **Timbuc Punks**: Complete quests for Niles "Stinky," participate in turf wars against rival gangs, and donate explosives to their cause. High reputation grants access to hidden weapon caches and punk-exclusive cybernetics.

- **MegaCorps**: Each corporation (NeuraTech, OmniCorp, Vitalix, Armatek, Quantum Dynamics) has its own reputation meter. Complete corporate quests, sabotage their rivals, and invest in their stocks. High reputation grants access to corporate areas and discounts on their products.

- **The Resistance**: Help sabotage corporate operations, rescue test subjects, and spread anti-corporate propaganda. High reputation grants access to secret hideouts and unique equipment.

- **Mod Doctors**: Volunteer for experimental procedures, provide rare materials, and refer new "patients." High reputation grants access to exclusive cybernetic enhancements.

- **Snack Liberation Front**: Help liberate vending machines from corporate control. High reputation grants access to the Vending Machine Collective Headquarters and special consumable items.

## Q: What happens if I make enemies with everyone?

A: If your reputation drops too low with all factions, you'll trigger the "Public Enemy" questline:

1. Bounty hunters from all factions will randomly attack you
2. Shops will charge you triple the normal prices
3. You'll gain access to the "Outcast Bunker" where other social pariahs gather
4. You can recruit unique "Outcast" companions who can't be obtained otherwise
5. You'll unlock the special "Against All Odds" ending where you and your fellow outcasts form your own faction

It's a challenging path, but some players prefer the "everyone hates me" approach for the unique content it unlocks.

## Q: Who is the final boss?

A: The final boss depends on your choices throughout the game:

- **A.S.P. Prime**: The default final boss if you follow the main storyline. A digital entity representing the core consciousness of the rogue AI.

- **Corporate Amalgamation**: If you betray the Resistance and side with the corporations, you'll face a merged consciousness of resistance leaders.

- **The Developer**: In the "Final Glitch" quest, you might face the game's developer who has become trapped in their own creation.

- **Your Doppelgänger**: If you make specific choices that fragment reality, you'll face an alternate version of yourself from a timeline where you sided with A.S.P.

- **Captain Calamari's Mother**: If you romance Captain Calamari and then break their heart, you'll face their mother - a giant octopus with cybernetic enhancements and a grudge.

## Q: Can NPCs die permanently?

A: Yes, most NPCs can die permanently based on your choices or failures:

- If you don't rescue Dr. Francine "Frankie" Stein during the B.M.N.E.C. meltdown, she'll be replaced by her "backup clone" (who has eight arms instead of six and a slightly different personality)

- If you don't stop the Burlap Pants Conspiracy in time, Mayor McFace will be permanently replaced by a burlap-wearing productivity zombie

- If you fail to protect The Narrator during the "Breaking the Fourth Wall" quest, Rex will lose the ability to perceive meta-commentary for the rest of the game

- If you don't regularly visit MAX-E-MUM's gym, they might overexert themselves and be replaced by MIN-I-MUM, their much less enthusiastic backup unit

The game tracks these changes and adjusts dialogue and available quests accordingly, creating a unique experience based on who lives and who dies.

## Q: Is there any way to bring back dead NPCs?

A: There are a few unconventional methods to resurrect dead NPCs:

1. **Zed's Reanimation Service**: For a hefty fee, Zed can create a "mostly functional" clone with most of the original's memories (and possibly some extra limbs)

2. **Digital Backup**: Characters with neural implants might have backups in the Matrix that can be downloaded into new bodies (with some corruption)

3. **Quantum Paradox**: Complete Professor Paradox's "Temporal Displacement" quest to access alternate timelines where specific characters didn't die

4. **The Narrator's Retcon**: If you have high enough reputation with The Narrator, they might agree to retcon a character's death (but will demand a narrative sacrifice in return)

Remember, in MegaEarth 2049, death is just another corporate service with flexible pricing options!
