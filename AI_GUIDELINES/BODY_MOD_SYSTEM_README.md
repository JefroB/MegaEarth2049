# Body Modification System

## Overview

The Body Modification System is a comprehensive gameplay mechanic that allows players to enhance their characters through cybernetic, biological, aesthetic, and experimental modifications. Unlike the clean, corporate-approved cybernetics of the elite, most wasteland dwellers rely on back-alley mod doctors using salvaged parts, experimental biotech, and questionable medical practices.

This system is centered around Zed's clinic "The Squeaky Clean" in Timbuc, where players can install, upgrade, and remove various modifications. Each modification offers unique benefits but also comes with potential side effects and compatibility issues with other mods.

## Key Components

### 1. Modification Categories

The system features four main categories of body modifications:

- **Cybernetic Modifications**: Mechanical enhancements that replace or augment body parts with technological components.
  - Examples: Mantis Blades, Targeting Optics, Neural Processor, Power Fists

- **Biological Modifications**: Organic enhancements that alter the body's natural functions through genetic manipulation, grafting, or chemical treatments.
  - Examples: Toxin Filters, Adrenal Boosters, Dermal Hardening, Regenerative Tissue

- **Aesthetic Modifications**: Appearance-altering modifications that may also provide minor functional benefits.
  - Examples: Circuit Patterns, Metallic Dermal Layers, Bioluminescent Tattoos, Chromatic Eyes

- **Experimental Modifications**: Highly unstable, unpredictable modifications with potentially powerful effects.
  - Examples: Probability Manipulator, Dimensional Storage, Quantum Stabilizer, Consciousness Splitter

### 2. Legendary Modifications

Special, extremely powerful modifications that can only be obtained through specific quests:

- **The Prometheus Hand**: A cybernetic hand that can generate and control fire
- **Chameleon Skin**: Advanced biological modification that allows near-perfect camouflage
- **The Third Eye**: A mysterious implant that allows the user to see invisible entities and energy patterns
- **Quantum Heart**: A replacement heart that exists partially outside normal space-time
- **The Hive Mind**: A neural implant that allows the user to mentally control insects and small creatures
- **Chronos Module**: A temporal manipulation device that can briefly slow time from the user's perspective

### 3. Clinic Access System

Players can return to Zed's clinic throughout the game using several methods:

- **Mod Doctor Hotline**: An item obtained by completing Zed's initial quest "The Guinea Pig"
- **Zed's VIP Card**: Obtained by completing the quest line "Spare Parts"
- **Distress Beacon**: Emergency extraction to Zed's clinic (with penalties)
- **Fast Travel Network**: All standard fast travel points have an option to travel directly to Timbuc

### 4. Quest System

A series of quests related to body modifications that unlock new modification options:

- **The Guinea Pig**: Zed's initial quest that unlocks basic modifications
