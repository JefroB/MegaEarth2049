# MegaEarth 2049 - Completion Guide

**IMPORTANT NOTE: MegaEarth 2049 is currently UNPLAYTESTED. All gameplay elements described in this guide are theoretical until properly tested.**

This document outlines the remaining tasks and elements needed to complete the MegaEarth 2049 game. It serves as a roadmap for finalizing the project and ensuring all necessary components are in place.

## Project History

MegaEarth 2049 began as a collaborative project between Jeffrey Charles Bornhoeft (copyright holder) and Scott Daniel Albright. After months of development, the project was temporarily set aside due to life circumstances and hidden from public view. Years later, with the advent of AI technology, the project was revitalized when:

1. Google Gemini analyzed the existing codebase and contributed to the story development
2. Claude Dev + VSCode integration helped fill in the remaining gaps and expand the project

This unique development history has contributed to the game's distinctive blend of human creativity and AI-assisted content generation.
