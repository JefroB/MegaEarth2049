## Q: How do I access the secret "Developer's Cut" ending?

A: The meta "Developer's Cut" ending is the most difficult to achieve:

1. **Break the Fourth Wall**: Complete The Narrator's quest line, starting with "The Fourth Wall Renovation."

2. **Collect Meta-References**: Find all 20 hidden meta-references throughout MegaEarth (items that reference game development).

3. **Glitch Exploitation**: Use Rex's Reality Glitch ability in specific locations to reveal "development artifacts" (unfinished areas, test rooms, etc.).

5. **The Final Patch**: In the Developer's Office, you'll face the Developer (who has become trapped in their own creation). Rather than fighting, you must help them "debug" the game by solving puzzles based on actual game development challenges.

6. **The Choice**: After helping the Developer, you're offered a choice:
   - Help them finish the game (leads to the "Developer's Cut" ending)
   - Convince them to let the characters determine their own fate (leads to a unique variation of your previously chosen ending)
   - Trap them in the game permanently and take their place in the real world (leads to a secret post-credits scene)

This ending breaks the fourth wall completely and includes numerous references to the actual development of MegaEarth 2049.
