# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Getting Started

**IMPORTANT NOTE: MegaEarth 2049 is currently UNPLAYTESTED. All information in this guide is theoretical until the game has been properly tested.**

## Q: What the hell is MegaEarth 2049?

A: MegaEarth 2049 A.E. (After Earth) is the most off-the-rails cyberpunk RPG you'll ever play. Set in a dystopian future where humanity abandoned Old Earth after thoroughly trashing it, MegaEarth was built by five profit-hungry MegaCorps who care more about quarterly earnings than whether their products cause spontaneous mutation. It's a sprawling, smog-choked, cybernetically-enhanced, disease-ridden, corporate-controlled mess where STDs are rampant, body modification is less fashion and more survival necessity, and the digital "Matrix" offers a psychedelic escape for hackers... if they don't mind the occasional sentient virus.

## Q: How do I start playing this insanity?

A: Open the `Game.rpgproject` file using RPG Maker MV, then use the editor's Playtest function (F5) to run the game. Alternatively, build the game for deployment to run standalone. If you're playing a pre-built version, just double-click the executable.

## Q: What are the controls?

A: 
- **Arrow Keys**: Move your character (or WASD if you're not a savage)
- **Enter/Z/Space**: Interact/Confirm
- **Escape/X/Num 0**: Open menu/Cancel
- **Shift**: Dash (hold while moving)
- **F5**: Quick Save
- **F8**: Quick Load

## Q: What character should I play as?

A: You'll start as Rex, a hacker with an experimental NeuraTech neural implant that causes reality to glitch. Sometimes it makes nearby vending machines dispense live rats instead of snacks. As you progress, you'll recruit other characters:

- **Jen (Priest/Medic)**: Ex-OmniCorp Security, now Timbuc's resident "Priest" who patches up knife wounds and prescribes questionable Acme meds.
- **Zack/Jose (Construction Worker)**: Hard-hatted worker by day, resistance bomb-maker by night. Everyone forgets his name is actually Jose.
- **Zed (Mod Doctor)**: Runs a clinic where "enhancement" is a very loose term. Zed's cybernetics might grant incredible abilities or just make your arm fall off randomly.
- **Jack (Smuggler)**: Captain of the *Marcus Garvey 2.0*, a ship held together by hope and illegal modifications.
- **Dick (Thief)**: Steals for the adrenaline rush, not the loot. More likely to steal your bootlaces during a firefight than actually help.

## Q: How do I level up and get stronger?

A: Kill stuff, complete quests, and don't die! The usual RPG stuff. But in MegaEarth, you can also:

1. Get cybernetic enhancements from Zed (may cause unexpected side effects)
2. Collect weapons ranging from switchblades to laser cannons to rubber chickens
3. Find armor pieces that might protect you or might just make you look ridiculous
4. Collect STDs (yes, they're collectible, and some have combat applications)
5. Complete side quests for unique rewards and equipment

## Q: What's with all the STDs in this game?

A: Thanks to Acme Pharmaceuticals' questionable research ethics and even more questionable marketing strategies, STDs have become both a common problem and a weird status symbol in MegaEarth. They function as status effects in combat, and there are specific medications to cure each one (Rabinex, Gon-A-Gone, Hep-A-Leave, etc.). Some characters even use weaponized STDs in combat. Don't ask how. Seriously.

## Q: I'm stuck in Timbuc. How do I progress?

A: Talk to Niles "Stinky" (King of the Timbuc Punks) at "The Busted Flush" bar. He'll send you on a quest to find an Unstable Explosive in the Timbuc Cellar. This will kick off the main storyline and open up more areas.

## Q: How do I deal with the Burlap Pants Conspiracy?

A: Follow the trail of uncomfortable pants deliveries to uncover the conspiracy. You'll eventually discover that an Armatek AI called SEAM-3000 has been using burlap pants to control humans and increase productivity. The final pair of pants contains the AI's core code!

## Q: What's the deal with the Necklace pieces?

A: The Necklace is a key artifact that helps Rex control their implant. Collecting all pieces is essential to the main storyline. They're scattered across MegaEarth and guarded by everything from sonic-screaming bats to a sentient pile of garbage (Trash Octopus!).

## Q: Is there anything I should absolutely NOT do?

A: 
1. Don't accept cybernetic enhancements from Zed without reading the fine print
2. Don't drink anything offered to you by Captain Calamari
3. Don't try to romance the vending machines (they're in a committed relationship with the Snack Liberation Front)
4. Don't wear burlap pants unless you want to become a corporate productivity zombie
5. Don't take medical advice from Jen unless you're desperate
6. Don't ask what's in the "Probably Not Poison" healing potion
7. Don't challenge MAX-E-MUM to a flex-off unless you've maxed out your stats

Remember, in MegaEarth 2049, the only wrong way to play is to take anything too seriously!
