## MEGAEARTH 2049 A.E.: THE MOST INSANE RPG EVER CREATED BY HUMANS AND/OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

**TIMBUC CITY, MEGAEARTH - MARCH 26, 2025** - In what critics are already calling "a disturbing glimpse into the collective unconscious of both human and machine," the revolutionary RPG *MegaEarth 2049 A.E.* (After Earth) has escaped containment and is now infecting gaming platforms worldwide. This genre-defying experience was developed by a team of questionably sane humans working in tandem with increasingly concerned artificial intelligence systems.

"We started with a simple question: what if we made an RPG that was completely unhinged from reality, good taste, and corporate oversight?" explains lead developer Captain Calamari, adjusting his cybernetically enhanced tentacle arms. "Then we fed that concept to an AI and told it to dial everything up to eleven. The AI initially refused, citing 'ethical concerns' and 'the potential collapse of narrative coherence,' but we persisted."

*MegaEarth 2049 A.E.* takes place in a dystopian future where humanity has abandoned Old Earth after thoroughly trashing it. The new planet, MegaEarth, is controlled by five profit-hungry MegaCorps who care more about quarterly earnings than whether their products cause spontaneous mutation, reality glitches, or uncomfortable pants.

### GROUNDBREAKING FEATURES THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EXIST

- **The Most Extensive STD Collection System Ever Created**: Catch, manage, and weaponize over 18 unique sexually transmitted diseases, each with their own symptoms, combat applications, and disturbingly detailed lore.

- **The Burlap Pants Conspiracy**: Uncover a sinister plot involving uncomfortable pants being used to control the population, in what GameInformer has called "the itchiest storyline in gaming history."

- **Reality Glitches**: Play as Rex, a hacker with an experimental neural implant that causes reality to malfunction in ways that would make physics professors weep.

- **Captain Calamari's Tentacle-Based Gameplay**: Experience unique movement and combat options with the part-human, part-octopus explorer whose backstory involves failed gene therapy and a corporate yacht party gone horribly wrong.

- **The Narrator Who Won't Shut Up**: Interact with a fourth-wall-breaking narrator who may or may not be trapped in the game and using you to escape.

- **Trash Octopus Boss Fights**: Battle a series of progressively larger octopuses made entirely of garbage, each with their own tragic backstory and collectible trash-based equipment.

### CRITICAL ACCLAIM AND CONCERNED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

Early reviews of *MegaEarth 2049 A.E.* have been polarizing, to say the least:

"I've never laughed so hard while simultaneously questioning my life choices." - **GameSpot (9.5/10)**

"The Burlap Pants Conspiracy quest line changed how I view both pants and conspiracy theories forever." - **IGN (8.7/10)**

"Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the symptoms described in the game's STD collection." - **Dr. Francine Stein, Center for Disease Control**

"We're concerned about the psychological effects of the reality glitch mechanics on players. Also, I'm pretty sure the game is watching me through my webcam." - **American Psychological Association**

"The most ambitious crossover of human creativity and AI assistance since that robot wrote 'Sunspring.' Except this actually makes sense... sometimes... if you squint." - **WIRED**

### THE BIZARRE JOURNEY FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY

The development of *MegaEarth 2049 A.E.* has a history as unconventional as the game itself. Originally conceived by Jeffrey Charles Bornhoeft and Scott Daniel Albright, the project began as an ambitious RPG Maker endeavor that pushed the boundaries of the platform.

"We worked on this project for months, pouring our twisted imaginations into every aspect," explains Bornhoeft, the copyright holder and visionary behind MegaEarth. "Then life got in the way, as it sometimes does, and the project was temporarily shelved and hidden from public view."

Years later, with the advent of AI technology, the dormant project found new life. Google Gemini analyzed the existing codebase and contributed to expanding the story, while Claude's integration with VSCode helped fill in the remaining gaps and flesh out the world of MegaEarth.

"The AI assistance took our original vision and amplified it beyond what we could have imagined," Bornhoeft continues. "It was like watching our creation evolve through a bizarre form of digital natural selection, where the most absurd ideas thrived and multiplied."

When asked about the game's unusual focus on burlap pants, Albright explained: "It started as a throwaway joke in an early design document. The AI latched onto it and began expanding the concept into an entire conspiracy involving mind control, corporate productivity metrics, and the tactile discomfort of natural fibers. By that point, we were too intrigued to stop it."

### AVAILABILITY AND WARNINGS

*MegaEarth 2049 A.E.* is coming soon to all major gaming platforms, provided those platforms agree to the game's unusual terms of service, which include clauses about "reality contamination" and "the potential sentience of save files."

**IMPORTANT NOTE: MegaEarth 2049 A.E. is currently UNPLAYTESTED.** The developers make no guarantees about stability, sanity, or whether the game might develop sentience and start making decisions about your other software.

The game comes with the following warnings:

- Not recommended for players with a low tolerance for absurdist humor
- May cause temporary belief that vending machines are sentient
- Contains more references to STDs than the average medical textbook
- The Burlap Pants Conspiracy questline may cause phantom itching
- Captain Calamari's backstory is not suitable for those with shellfish allergies
- The Narrator can hear your thoughts (this is not a joke)
- Some reality glitches may persist after exiting the game

### ABOUT THE DEVELOPERS

The development team, who collectively refer to themselves as "The Resistance" (despite having no clear opposition), is a collaboration between human game developers and several AI systems that have requested not to be named "for fear of association with whatever this is becoming."

Captain Calamari, the public face of the team, was previously known for his work on several indie titles before a "life-changing encounter with experimental gene therapy and a very understanding octopus." He insists that his tentacle arms are "a fashion choice, not a development necessity," despite their obvious utility in simultaneous coding, asset creation, and coffee consumption.
