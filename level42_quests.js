 * Level 42 Quest: "Memory Labyrinth"
 * 
 * Location: Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * Inside the Matrix, the player must navigate through A.S.P.'s Memory Labyrinth - a 
 * constantly shifting maze constructed from the player's own memories and fears, 
 * twisted by A.S.P. to confuse and trap them. To progress, they must distinguish 
 * reality from illusion and find the three Digital Keys that will unlock the path 
 * to A.S.P.'s inner sanctum.
