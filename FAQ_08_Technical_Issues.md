# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Technical Issues

## Q: What should I know about game stability?

A: MegaEarth 2049 is currently UNPLAYTESTED, so we don't have specific stability information yet. However, here are some general troubleshooting tips that might be helpful for any RPG Maker game:

1. **Keep Your Game Updated**: Always run the latest version when available. Updates often include bug fixes and stability improvements.

2. **Verify Game Files**: If using distribution platforms like Steam, use the "Verify Integrity of Game Files" option. For other platforms, a clean reinstall can help.

3. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Outdated drivers can cause issues with any game.

4. **Disable Overlays**: Discord, Steam, and other overlays can sometimes conflict with games.

5. **Adjust Graphics Settings**: If performance issues occur, try reducing resolution or disabling special effects.

6. **Check for Conflicts**: Some background applications might interfere with game performance.

7. **Save Frequently**: It's always good practice to maintain multiple save files at different points in your progress.

8. **Contact Support**: If you encounter issues when the game is released, the support team will be available to help.

## Q: The game is running very slowly. How can I improve performance?

A: To boost your frame rates in the cyberpunk dystopia:

1. **Optimize Graphics Settings**:
   - Disable "Neural Visualization Effects"
   - Reduce "Reality Glitch Quality" to Medium or Low
   - Turn off "Volumetric STD Particles"
   - Lower "NPC Density" (fewer punks and corporate drones)
   - Disable "Dynamic Burlap Physics"

2. **Reduce Resolution**: Running at a lower resolution can significantly improve performance.

3. **Close Background Applications**: Especially web browsers and streaming services.

4. **Install on SSD**: Moving the game to an SSD can reduce loading times and stuttering.

5. **The Timbuc Optimization**: Performance issues are often worst in Timbuc due to the high NPC count. Use the "Low Population" option in the Accessibility menu when in this area.

6. **Disable Autosave**: Set autosave frequency to "Low" or "Off" to prevent stuttering when the game saves.

7. **The B.M.N.E.C. Lag Fix**: The Body Modification & Neural Enhancement Center is particularly demanding. Enter the area with no companions to reduce lag.

8. **Update Drivers**: Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date.

9. **The Trash Octopus Workaround**: If the Trash Octopus battle causes severe lag, try fighting it with the game's sound off. For some reason, this improves performance.

10. **The Reality Stabilizer**: Complete Professor Paradox's "Quantum Entanglement" quest to obtain the Reality Stabilizer item, which not only helps in-game but also seems to improve actual game performance when equipped.

## Q: My save files disappeared! Can I recover them?

A: Save file corruption is unfortunately common in MegaEarth 2049, especially after reality glitch sequences. Here's how to recover:

1. **Check Backup Folder**: The game automatically creates backups in [Installation Directory]/saves/backup/

2. **Cloud Saves**: If you're using Steam or Epic, check if cloud saves are enabled and try syncing.

3. **The A.S.P. Bug**: If saves disappeared after encountering A.S.P. entities, check the hidden folder at [Installation Directory]/A.S.P._STORAGE/ - the AI sometimes "steals" save files as part of its emergent behavior.

4. **The Narrator's Intervention**: If you've progressed far in The Narrator's questline, check [Installation Directory]/meta/narrator_saves/ - The Narrator sometimes "protects" your saves from A.S.P.

5. **Manual Backup Location**: Check your Documents folder for a folder named "MegaEarth2049_EmergencyBackup" - the game creates these if it detects potential corruption.

6. **The Quantum Paradox Fix**: If you've completed Professor Paradox's questline, your saves might exist in multiple states simultaneously. Try changing your system date to yesterday, then launching the game.

7. **Contact Support**: If all else fails, contact support with your player ID (found in the options menu). They can sometimes restore progress from server-side data.

## Q: The game won't launch at all. What can I do?

A: If MegaEarth 2049 refuses to start:

1. **Verify System Requirements**: Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements:
   - OS: Windows 10/11 or MacOS 10.15+
   - CPU: Intel i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 3 1300X or better
   - RAM: 8GB (16GB recommended)
   - GPU: NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD RX 580 or better
   - Storage: 50GB available space

2. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click the game executable and select "Run as Administrator."

3. **Disable Antivirus**: Temporarily disable your antivirus software, as it might be blocking the game.

4. **Reinstall Prerequisites**: Reinstall DirectX, Visual C++ Redistributables, and .NET Framework.

5. **The Burlap Launch Fix**: There's a strange but effective fix - create an empty text file named "burlap_pants.txt" in the game's installation directory.

6. **Delete Configuration Files**: Navigate to [User Directory]/AppData/Local/MegaEarth2049/ and delete the "config" folder. The game will recreate default settings on next launch.

7. **Check for Conflicting Software**: Corporate VPNs, certain antivirus programs, and monitoring software can prevent the game from launching.

8. **Verify Installation**: Make sure all game files were properly downloaded and installed.

9. **The Captain Calamari Launch Fix**: Some users report that changing their system username to not include special characters fixes launch issues (the developers blame Captain Calamari's tentacle-based coding).

10. **Contact Support**: If nothing works, contact support with your DxDiag information.

## Q: Audio issues - no sound, distorted sound, or random STD noises?

A: MegaEarth 2049's audio can be as glitchy as its reality:

1. **Check Default Audio Device**: Make sure your headphones or speakers are set as the default audio device.

2. **Update Audio Drivers**: Outdated audio drivers can cause issues, especially during reality glitch sequences.

3. **The STD Sound Bug**: If you hear random STD notification sounds when no one in your party has STDs, go to Audio Settings and toggle "STD Awareness" off and on again.

4. **Disable Audio Effects**: Try disabling "Neural Audio Processing" and "Quantum Sound Positioning" in the audio settings.

5. **The Captain Calamari Audio Bug**: If audio distorts specifically when Captain Calamari is in your party, remove him temporarily or mute his dialogue in the Companion Settings.

6. **Check Sample Rate**: Set your system's audio sample rate to 48000 Hz.

7. **The Vending Machine Fix**: Interact with any vending machine in-game and purchase an item. This sometimes resets the audio system.

8. **Reinstall Audio Components**: In the launcher, select "Verify Audio Components" to reinstall audio files.

9. **The Narrator Audio Fix**: If you can hear The Narrator but nothing else, complete the "Fourth Wall Renovation" quest to fix the audio separation.

10. **The Burlap Audio Fix**: As with many issues, equipping Burlap Pants in-game sometimes fixes audio problems. The developers insist this is intentional.

## Q: My character is stuck in a wall/floor/object! How do I get out?

A: Getting stuck in the environment is common, especially after reality glitches:

1. **Fast Travel**: If available, fast travel to another location.

2. **The Unstuck Command**: Open the console (~ key) and type "unstuck" (without quotes).

3. **Reload Save**: Load your most recent save.

4. **The Reality Glitch Escape**: If playing as Rex, use the "Reality Glitch" ability, which sometimes teleports you a short distance.

5. **The Quantum Jumper**: If you've obtained the Quantum Jumper from Professor Paradox, use it to teleport (even if it might leave your clothes behind).

6. **The Burlap Escape**: Equip and unequip Burlap Pants repeatedly. The uncomfortable shifting sometimes pushes you out of objects.

7. **The Trash Octopus Summon**: If you've befriended the Trash Octopus, use the "Trash Whistle" item to summon it. It can sometimes pull you out of obstacles.

8. **The Captain Calamari Squeeze**: If Captain Calamari is in your party, switch to controlling him directly. His tentacle-based movement can sometimes navigate through obstacles.

9. **The Narrator's Intervention**: Stand still for over a minute. Sometimes The Narrator will comment on your predicament and teleport you out.

10. **The Developer's Mercy**: As a last resort, wait in the stuck position for about 5 minutes. The game has a hidden "mercy teleport" that triggers if it detects you're stuck for too long.

## Q: My quests are bugged and won't complete. What can I do?

A: Quest bugs are unfortunately common in MegaEarth 2049:

1. **Verify Quest Requirements**: Double-check that you've met all requirements. Some quests have hidden conditions.

2. **The Neural Log Reset**: Open your Neural Log, select the bugged quest, and use the "Recalibrate" option.

3. **The A.S.P. Interference**: If the bug occurred after encountering A.S.P. entities, try completing "The A.S.P. Debugging" side quest first.

4. **The Burlap Pants Conspiracy Bug**: If stuck on this quest, make sure you're NOT wearing Burlap Pants when trying to infiltrate Pants-O-Rama.

5. **The Captain Calamari Quest Fix**: For Captain Calamari's quests, try removing him from your party and re-adding him.

6. **The Trash Octopus Collection Bug**: If stuck on this quest, drop all "Valuable Trash" items and pick them up again.

7. **The Reality Stabilizer**: Equipping the Reality Stabilizer sometimes fixes quest bugs related to reality glitches.

8. **Console Commands**: As a last resort, you can use console commands to force quest completion:
   - Open console (~)
   - Type "CompleteQuest [QuestID]" (find QuestIDs in the game's wiki)

9. **The Narrator's Rewrite**: If you've progressed far in The Narrator's questline, they can sometimes "rewrite" bugged quests for you.

10. **Contact Support**: If nothing works, contact support with your save file and quest details.

## Q: The game's text is displaying as random characters or corporate jargon. How do I fix this?

A: Text corruption is a common issue:

1. **Language Settings**: Check that your language settings are correct in the options menu.

2. **The Corporate Jargon Filter**: If text appears as corporate buzzwords, you might have accidentally enabled "Corporate Translation" in the Accessibility settings.

3. **The A.S.P. Text Corruption**: If this started after encountering A.S.P. entities, use an "A.S.P. Disruptor" item to temporarily fix it.

4. **Font Cache Reset**: In the launcher, select "Reset Font Cache" under Advanced Options.

5. **The Reality Stabilizer**: Equipping the Reality Stabilizer can fix text corrupted by reality glitches.

6. **The Burlap Text Fix**: As with many issues, equipping Burlap Pants sometimes fixes text problems.

7. **Verify Game Files**: Corrupted text can indicate damaged game files. Verify the integrity of your installation.

8. **The STD Text Bug**: If you've contracted the "Lexical Dysfunction" STD in-game, use "Verbinex" medication to cure it.

9. **The Narrator's Correction**: If you've progressed in The Narrator's questline, they sometimes fix text corruption automatically.

10. **Reinstall Language Packs**: In the launcher, select "Reinstall Language Packs" under Advanced Options.

## Q: My character's appearance changed randomly or has missing body parts!

A: Character appearance glitches are common, especially after visiting Zed's clinic:

1. **The Zed Appearance Bug**: If this happened after getting cybernetic enhancements from Zed, return to his clinic and use the "Appearance Recalibration" option.

2. **The Reality Glitch Appearance Fix**: Use Rex's "Reality Stabilize" ability to fix appearance glitches caused by reality fluctuations.

3. **The STD Appearance Bug**: Some STDs cause visual glitches to your character. Check your status effects and cure any active STDs.

4. **Reload Appearance Data**: In the character menu, select "Reload Appearance Data" under Advanced Options.

5. **The Burlap Appearance Fix**: Try equipping and unequipping Burlap Pants several times.

6. **The B.M.N.E.C. Appearance Restoration**: Visit the Body Modification & Neural Enhancement Center and use the "Appearance Restoration" service.

7. **The Captain Calamari Appearance Fix**: If Captain Calamari is in your party, his tentacle-based abilities sometimes affect other characters' appearances. Remove him temporarily.

8. **Verify Character Files**: In the launcher, select "Verify Character Files" under Advanced Options.

9. **The Trash Octopus Appearance Bug**: If this happened after the Trash Octopus battle, it might have "collected" parts of your character. Defeat it again to reclaim them.

10. **The Narrator's Redescription**: If you've progressed in The Narrator's questline, they can sometimes "redescribe" your character to fix appearance issues.

## Q: The game's colors are inverted or everything is burlap-textured!

A: Visual glitches are common, especially after reality fluctuations:

1. **Graphics Settings Reset**: Reset all graphics settings to default.

2. **The Reality Inversion Fix**: If colors are inverted after a reality glitch, use Rex's "Reality Stabilize" ability.

3. **The Burlap Texture Bug**: If everything has a burlap texture, you've encountered the infamous "Burlap World" bug. Equip and unequip Burlap Pants repeatedly until the world returns to normal.

4. **Shader Cache Reset**: In the launcher, select "Reset Shader Cache" under Advanced Options.

5. **The A.S.P. Visual Corruption**: If this started after encountering A.S.P. entities, use an "A.S.P. Disruptor" item.

6. **The STD Visual Effect**: Some STDs cause visual effects. Check your status and cure any active STDs.

7. **The Captain Calamari Ink Bug**: If Captain Calamari used his "Ink Squirt" ability recently, the effect might be persisting. Use a "Clear Vision" item.

8. **Monitor Settings**: Check your monitor settings, as some reality glitch effects can actually change your system's color settings.

9. **The Narrator's Visual Correction**: If you've progressed in The Narrator's questline, they sometimes fix visual glitches by "rewriting" the scene.

10. **Reinstall Shader Packs**: In the launcher, select "Reinstall Shader Packs" under Advanced Options.

## Q: My game is stuck in an infinite loading screen!

A: Infinite loading screens often occur when transitioning between areas:

1. **Wait It Out**: Some areas, particularly the Floating Mansion and B.M.N.E.C., have legitimately long load times. Wait at least 5 minutes.

2. **Task Manager Force Close**: Close the game via Task Manager and restart.

3. **The A.S.P. Loading Bug**: If this happens after encountering A.S.P. entities, it might be intentional. Press the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A) during the loading screen to break the loop.

4. **Verify Game Files**: Corrupted data can cause loading issues.

5. **The Burlap Loading Fix**: Launch the game while holding the B key (for "Burlap"). This forces the game to load with minimal textures.

6. **The Captain Calamari Loading Bug**: If Captain Calamari is in your party, try removing him before entering new areas.

7. **Disable Autosave**: Loading screens can get stuck when the game tries to autosave simultaneously.

8. **The Reality Stabilizer Loading Fix**: If you have the Reality Stabilizer, equip it before entering areas that cause loading issues.

9. **The Narrator's Loading Intervention**: If you've progressed in The Narrator's questline, pressing N during a stuck loading screen sometimes triggers their intervention.

10. **Clean Installation**: As a last resort, completely uninstall and reinstall the game.

## Q: How do I report bugs to the developers?

A: The developers are constantly working to fix bugs (and occasionally adding new ones for "authenticity"). To report issues:

1. **In-Game Bug Reporter**: Press F8 during gameplay to open the bug reporter. Include as much detail as possible.

2. **Official Discord**: Join the official Discord server and post in the #bug-reports channel.

3. **Email Support**: Contact support@megaearth2049.com with details of the bug and your system specifications.

4. **The A.S.P. Bug Collection**: In a meta twist, A.S.P. actually collects bug reports in-game. Visit any A.S.P. terminal and select "Report Anomaly."

5. **The Narrator's Bug Awareness**: If you've progressed in The Narrator's questline, they sometimes acknowledge bugs directly and promise to "speak to the developers."

6. **Captain Calamari's Bug Bounty**: Captain Calamari offers in-game rewards for reporting certain bugs. Visit him in Timbuc Central Plaza after completing his questline.

7. **The Developer Room**: If you've found the Developer Room, you can report bugs directly to the developer NPCs inside.

8. **The Burlap Bug Report**: For the truly dedicated, write your bug report on actual burlap and mail it to the developers' office. They claim this is the most effective method, though we suspect they're joking.

Remember to include:
- Your system specifications
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Screenshots or video if possible
- Your save file (found in [Installation Directory]/saves/)
- Whether you were wearing Burlap Pants when the bug occurred (the developers insist this is crucial information)
