# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - Thesaurus of Corporate Dystopia

## Introduction

Welcome to the MegaEarth 2049 Thesaurus, the essential reference guide for understanding the absurd hellscape of late-stage capitalism in space. Unlike our Dictionary, which merely defines terms, this Thesaurus organizes concepts thematically to reveal the interconnected web of corporate oppression, environmental devastation, and bizarre mutations that define our world.

This document was compiled by the Underground Documentation Collective, a group of rogue archivists who risk their lives to document corporate atrocities while hiding from OmniCorp's Grammar Enforcement Division. Several members were captured during the creation of this document and are now forced to write technical manuals for products that don't exist.

Remember: In a world where reality itself is a commodity that can be bought, sold, and manipulated by those with enough credits, having the right words to describe your oppression is the first step toward liberation. Or at least toward making better jokes about it while we all slowly die of Experimental Fluid poisoning.

## Conclusion

This thesaurus is a living document, much like the mutated flora and fauna of our beloved wasteland. As corporate atrocities evolve, so too must our language to describe them. Remember that in the struggle against capitalist oppression, having the right words is as important as having the right weapons.

If you find this document, please add your own entries and pass it along. Knowledge, like wealth, should be shared—unlike wealth, it actually does trickle down when you do so.

*P.S. If you're a corporate spy reading this, we've included a special neurolinguistic trigger phrase that will activate your dormant conscience. It's hidden somewhere in this document. Sweet dreams!*
