# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - Rhyming Dictionary

## Introduction

Welcome to the MegaEarth 2049 Rhyming Dictionary, the essential tool for wasteland poets, apocalyptic rappers, and dystopian bards. This reference organizes the unique terminology of our post-apocalyptic world into rhyming groups, making it easier to create verse that captures the grim reality and dark humor of life after the collapse.

This document was compiled by the Underground Documentation Collective's Poetry Division, a group of rogue wordsmiths who believe that even in the darkest timeline, there's still room for sick rhymes. Several members were captured during open mic nights and are now forced to write corporate jingles for products that cause cancer.

Remember: In a world where survival is uncertain, a well-crafted verse can be as valuable as clean water or uncontaminated food. Poetry is the language of resistance, the rhythm of revolution, and occasionally, the only thing that keeps us sane in this corporate hellscape.

## Wasteland Poetry Forms

### The Corporate Haiku

A 5-7-5 syllable poem that captures the essence of corporate dystopia:

```
OmniCorp watching
Brain Stapler ready to fire
Thought Crime detected
```

### The Wasteland Sonnet

A 14-line poem with a rhyme scheme that explores the beauty in devastation:

```
Among the ruins of a world long dead,
Where Experimental Fluid pools like rain,
A Trash Octopus makes its humble bed,
Finding purpose in what others disdain.

The Corporate Zones loom tall against the sky,
Their gleaming walls a promise and a threat.
Outside their bounds, the Waste Wizards get by,
Transforming garbage into gold, and yet

The Glitch Witch works her technological spells,
The Gunk Punk creates art from toxic waste,
The Sewer Sommelier somehow excels
At finding food with surprisingly good taste.

In this broken world of corporate design,
The human spirit somehow still shines fine.
```

### The Apocalypse Rap Battle

A form where two wasteland characters trade increasingly devastating rhymes:

```
CORPORATE DRONE:
I got the Corporate Access Card, level nine,
Clean water, filtered air, everything's fine.
You're just a Gunk Punk living in waste,
While I got Liquid Courage to help me save face.

WASTE WIZARD:
Your Chemical Leash keeps you locked in place,
That Corporate Drone life is a total disgrace.
I transform trash into tools with my hands,
While you're just a puppet to corporate demands.
```
