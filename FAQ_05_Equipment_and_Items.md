# MegaEarth 2049 A.E. - FAQ: Equipment and Items

## Q: What types of equipment can I find in MegaEarth 2049?

A: MegaEarth 2049 features a wide variety of equipment types, ranging from practical to absurd:

- **Weapons**: From simple switchblades to advanced energy weapons
- **Armor**: Head, body, legs, feet, and hands protection
- **Accessories**: Rings, amulets, and other stat-boosting trinkets
- **Cybernetic Enhancements**: Implants and modifications from Zed's clinic
- **Neural Programs**: Software for Rex's implant
- **Fashion Items**: Purely cosmetic items that might impress certain NPCs
- **Corporate Badges**: Access passes to restricted areas
- **Burlap Pants**: Avoid at all costs

## Q: What are the best weapons in the game?

A: The "best" weapons depend on your playstyle and character build, but here are some top contenders:

- **BFG (Big Fucking Gun)**: Highest raw damage but slow rate of fire and heavy weight
- **Chainsaw**: Devastating melee weapon with chance to cause Bleed status
- **Alien Laser Canon**: Balanced energy weapon with high accuracy and elemental damage
- **Rune Blade**: Sword that scales with both physical and magical stats
- **Finger Guns**: Joke weapon that becomes surprisingly powerful with the right build
- **Railgun**: Pierces armor and has high critical chance
- **Flamethrower**: Area damage with chance to cause Burn status
- **Rubber Chicken**: Seemingly useless until fully upgraded, then becomes one of the strongest weapons

For Dick specifically, the **Yo-Yo** is his ultimate weapon when paired with his "Steal Identity" ability.

## Q: What's the deal with the weird armor options?

A: MegaEarth 2049's armor system is as bizarre as everything else in the game. Some notable armor pieces include:

- **Trench Coat**: Increases evasion and makes you look like a creeper
- **Burlap Pants**: Uncomfortable pants that reduce all stats but are part of certain quests
- **Hazmat Suit**: Protects against environmental hazards and certain status effects
- **Kevlar Vest**: High physical defense but low magical defense
- **Hockey Mask**: Intimidating but not very protective
- **Stealth Suit**: Increases agility and stealth capabilities
- **Clown Shoes**: Large and clumsy, reduces agility
- **Gas Mask**: Protects against airborne toxins
- **Cracked Goggles**: Almost useless but better than nothing
- **Armortech Gear**: High-tech armor with balanced stats

Mix and match armor pieces to create sets that complement your playstyle, or just wear whatever looks most ridiculous.

## Q: How do cybernetic enhancements work?

A: Cybernetic enhancements are special equipment obtained from Zed's clinic, "The Squeaky Clean." Unlike regular equipment, cybernetics:

1. Permanently replace body parts
2. Cannot be easily removed (requires surgery)
3. May have unexpected side effects
4. Often provide unique abilities not available through regular equipment
5. Can malfunction under certain conditions

Popular cybernetic enhancements include:
- **Ocular Implants**: Enhanced vision, targeting systems
- **Neural Processors**: Increased hacking abilities, resistance to mind control
- **Reinforced Skeleton**: Increased physical defense and strength
- **Synthetic Organs**: Resistance to status effects, automatic health regeneration
- **Dermal Plating**: Integrated armor that doesn't take up equipment slots
- **Reflex Boosters**: Increased agility and reaction time
- **Weaponized Limbs**: Built-in weapons that can't be disarmed

Always read the fine print before accepting one of Zed's "special offers."

## Q: What consumable items should I always keep in my inventory?

A: Essential consumables for survival in MegaEarth:

1. **Healing Items**:
   - Acetaminophen (basic healing)
   - Ibuprofen (medium healing)
   - Oxycontin (full healing)
   - Elixir (restores HP and MP)

2. **Status Cures**:
   - Dried Green Herb (cures basic status ailments)
   - Fresh Green Herb (cures most negative statuses)
   - Panacea (cures all negative status effects except KO)
   - STD Medications (Rabinex, Gon-A-Gone, Hep-A-Leave, etc.)
   - Colon Blow (cures Constipation)
   - Corkinex (cures Diarrhea)

3. **Buffs**:
   - Buff-er-in (boosts ATK)
   - Iron Skin Draught (boosts DEF)
   - Mind Elixir (boosts MAT)
   - Barrier Tonic (boosts MDF)
   - Swiftness Potion (boosts AGI)
   - Lucky Clover Brew (boosts LUK)
   - Combat Stim Pack (boosts all stats)

4. **Battle Items**:
   - Grenades (various types for different effects)
   - Protectionâ„¢ (prevents STDs for 5 turns)
   - Cryo Grenade (ice damage to all enemies)
   - Plasma Grenade (fire damage to all enemies)

5. **Utility Items**:
   - Vend-O-Matic Tokens (for vending machines)
   - Quantum Stabilizer (prevents reality glitches)
   - A.S.P. Disruptor (temporarily disables A.S.P. entities)

## Q: Where can I find rare equipment?

A: The best equipment is often hidden in obscure locations or locked behind challenging quests:

1. **Corporate Headquarters**: Each MegaCorp (NeuraTech, OmniCorp, Vitalix, Armatek, Quantum Dynamics) has a secret R&D lab with prototype equipment.

2. **The Floating Mansion**: Dr. Voss's abandoned sky-palace contains several unique items, including the Reality Stabilizer and Quantum Jumper.

3. **Planet Ork's Dungeon**: The haunted mines contain rare minerals used in high-tier energy weapons.

4. **The Quantum Quandary Casino**: On Planet Needsaname, you can gamble for rare equipment (but beware, probabilities shift based on how much you're winning).

5. **Trash Octopus's Lair**: After defeating the Trash Octopus, you can return to its lair to find items it has "collected" from all over MegaEarth.

6. **The Narrator's Pocket Dimension**: If you break the fourth wall enough times, The Narrator might invite you to their dimension where meta-equipment can be found.

7. **Clown Court Evidence Room**: Hidden beneath The Laughing Stock, contains confiscated items from previous "trials."

8. **Vending Machine Collective Headquarters**: Secret base of the Snack Liberation Front, offers unique consumables not available elsewhere.

## Q: What's the deal with the "Probably Not Poison" healing potion?

A: "Probably Not Poison" is a mysterious healing item manufactured by Acme Pharmaceuticals. It restores a random amount of HP (anywhere from 1 to 9999) and has a 10% chance of applying one of the following effects:

1. Full heal and status cure (jackpot!)
2. Temporary invincibility
3. Random stat boost
4. Random stat decrease
5. Random status effect
6. Transformation into a small animal (temporary)
7. Swapping positions with a random party member
8. Attracting or repelling enemies
9. Changing the background music
10. Nothing at all

Despite its name, it's technically not poison... most of the time. The "Definitely Not Poison" variant sold in Timbuc 2 is, ironically, definitely poison.

## Q: How do I upgrade my equipment?

A: Equipment can be upgraded through several methods:

1. **The Twins (Bit & Byte)**: Visit their shop in Timbuc to enhance weapons and armor using rare materials.

2. **Zed's Modifications**: Zed can add special properties to equipment, but there's always a risk of unexpected side effects.

3. **Corporate Terminals**: Hack into corporate terminals to download upgrade schematics for tech-based equipment.

4. **Quantum Infusion**: Professor Paradox can infuse equipment with quantum particles, giving them random properties from parallel universes.

5. **Trash Recycling**: The Trash King can transform junk items into upgraded equipment (quality varies wildly).

6. **STD Contamination**: Certain equipment can be "enhanced" by exposing it to specific STDs. This is as disgusting and risky as it sounds.

7. **Reality Glitch Exploitation**: Rex can use their implant to temporarily "convince" reality that equipment is better than it actually is.

## Q: What are the most useless items in the game?

A: MegaEarth 2049 includes several seemingly useless items that might have hidden purposes:

1. **Burlap Underwear**: Even more uncomfortable than Burlap Pants, with no apparent benefit.

2. **Corporate Ethics Manual**: A book so contradictory it causes confusion when read.

3. **Leaky Boots**: Boots with holes that reduce agility and make squelching sounds.

4. **Expired Burrito**: Food item that always causes Diarrhea when consumed.

5. **Torn Shirt**: Armor with negative defense values.

6. **Jinxed Ring**: Accessory that lowers luck.

7. **Pee Shooter**: Weapon that deals minimal damage and might inflict disease.

8. **Cracked Mirror Shield**: Reflects some magic but has a chance to reflect it back at you.

9. **Underwear Hat**: Humiliating and useless headgear.

10. **Goofy Hat**: Ridiculously oversized hat that applies negative stats across the board.

However, some of these items are actually required for specific quests or have secret uses when combined with other items. The Burlap Underwear, for example, is the key to defeating the final form of SEAM-3000 in the Burlap Pants Conspiracy questline.

## Q: How does the inventory system work?

A: MegaEarth 2049 uses a somewhat realistic inventory system with the following features:

1. **Weight Limits**: Each character can carry a limited amount based on their Strength stat.

2. **Shared Inventory**: The party shares a common inventory for most items.

3. **Equipment Slots**: Each character has slots for head, body, legs, feet, hands, and accessories.

4. **Quick Access**: Up to 10 items can be assigned to quick access slots for battle.

5. **Storage**: Items can be stored in various locations (Zack's Bunker, Jack's Ship, etc.)

6. **Auto-Sort**: Items can be sorted by type, value, or weight.

7. **Junk Items**: Items marked as "junk" can be mass-sold to vendors.

8. **Contraband**: Certain items are illegal in corporate areas and will be confiscated if discovered.

9. **Degradation**: Some items degrade with use and need to be repaired.

10. **STD Contamination**: Items can become contaminated if carried by infected characters, potentially spreading the infection to others.

## Q: What's the most overpowered item combination?

A: The most broken combination in the game is:

1. **Finger Guns** + **Overconfidence Mod** + **Pew Pew Enhancer** + **Reality Glitch**

This combination allows you to deal massive damage while consuming minimal resources. The Finger Guns normally do joke damage, but when enhanced by the Overconfidence Mod (from Zed), upgraded with the Pew Pew Enhancer, and amplified by Rex's Reality Glitch ability, they can one-shot most bosses.

Another powerful combination is:

2. **Protectionâ„¢** + **Weaponized STDs** + **Pandemic Party Bonus**

By deliberately infecting your entire party with controlled STDs while using Protectionâ„¢ to prevent additional infections, you can maintain the Pandemic Party Bonus (10% to all stats) while using Weaponized STDs to inflict devastating status effects on enemies.

The developers have acknowledged these exploits but refuse to patch them because they're "too funny to remove."
