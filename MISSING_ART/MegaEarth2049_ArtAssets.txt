- Enemy designs should be memorable and often incorporate humorous elements
- Environmental art should convey the dystopian yet absurd nature of MegaEarth
- Special attention should be given to glitch effects and digital distortions
- Color palette should include neon colors against dark backgrounds for cyberpunk areas
- Corporate facilities should have sterile, minimalist designs with corporate logos
- Alien worlds should be visually distinct from Earth-based environments
- UI elements should be clean and readable while maintaining the cyberpunk aesthetic
- Animations should be smooth but maintain the pixel art style (no tweening)
- Consider the game's humor when designing assets - exaggeration and absurdity are welcome
