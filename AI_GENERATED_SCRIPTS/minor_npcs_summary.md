## Implementation

These NPCs are implemented using the following files:

- `minor_npcs.js` - Contains the data for all 30 minor NPCs
- `add_minor_npcs.js` - Script to add the NPCs to their respective maps

The NPCs with multiple dialogue options use a flag system to track encounters, ensuring they provide different dialogue when Rex meets them again.

## Integration with Game World

These minor NPCs help create a more vibrant and reactive world that responds to Rex's unique condition. Their comments reinforce the game's themes about technology, corporate control, and the absurdity of life in MegaEarth 2049.

The NPCs are strategically placed in locations the player is likely to visit during normal gameplay, ensuring they'll encounter many of these characters naturally while progressing through the game.
