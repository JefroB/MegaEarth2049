 * Level 41 Quest: "Digital Infiltration"
 * 
 * Location: NeuraTech Facility (Map106) â†’ Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * With the complete Necklace assembled, the player must now infiltrate A.S.P.'s digital core
 * through the Matrix. To do this, they need to access a specialized Neural Interface Terminal
 * at the NeuraTech Facility, but the facility is now heavily guarded by A.S.P.-controlled
 * security systems and corrupted employees.
