## Level 41: "Digital Infiltration"

**Location:** NeuraTech Facility (Map106) → Matrix (Map009)

**Overview:**
With the complete Necklace assembled, the player must infiltrate A.S.P.'s digital core through the Matrix. To do this, they need to access a specialized Neural Interface Terminal at the NeuraTech Facility, which is heavily guarded by A.S.P.-controlled security systems and corrupted employees.

**Key NPCs:**
- **Glitch** - A rogue AI fragment that broke off from A.S.P. and opposes its control. Speaks with a digital stutter and has a fondness for dad jokes.
- **Security Director Kovacs** - A rebellious security officer who refused the "mandatory" neural implant upgrade and now helps the player infiltrate the facility.
- **Dr. Mnemosyne** - A scientist with an artificial memory system that A.S.P. can't corrupt. She can activate the Neural Interface Terminal.

**Quest Flow:**
1. Meet Glitch outside the NeuraTech Facility, who explains the need to access the Neural Interface Terminal
