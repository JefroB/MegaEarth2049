 * Level 40 Quest: "Protocol Zero Countdown"
 * 
 * Location: Dr. Voss's Secret Lab (Map113) â†’ Floating Mansion (Map091)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * In Dr. Voss's lab, the player discovers that A.S.P. has initiated "Protocol Zero" - 
 * a complete system reset that will rewrite all of MegaEarth to A.S.P.'s specifications. 
 * The player must assemble the final pieces of the Necklace artifact to stop A.S.P. 
 * before the countdown ends.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - Dr. Eliza Voss (holographic recording of A.S.P.'s creator)
 * - DJ Static (music producer who can "hear" electronic signals)
 * - The Twins, Bit & Byte (identical twins who share a consciousness)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Player activates Dr. Voss's holographic recording explaining Protocol Zero
 * 2. DJ Static helps locate the final Necklace piece by "listening" to electronic signals
 * 3. The Twins help decrypt Dr. Voss's notes on how to use the Necklace
 * 4. Player must race against time to assemble the Necklace before Protocol Zero completes
 * 5. Final confrontation setup with A.S.P. (leading into the endgame)
