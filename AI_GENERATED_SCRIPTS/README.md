# AI-Generated Scripts

This directory contains scripts that were generated by AI to assist with the MegaEarth2049 project. These scripts help with various tasks such as:

- Adding quests and events to maps
- Managing game content
- Organizing files
- Processing JSON data
- Creating and managing NPCs
- Implementing game features

## Usage Guidelines

1. All AI-generated scripts should be placed in this directory to keep the root directory clean.
2. When creating new scripts, save them directly to this folder.
3. If you find AI-generated scripts in the root directory, please move them here.
4. Scripts in this directory can be executed from the root directory using relative paths, e.g., `node AI_generated_scripts/script_name.js`
