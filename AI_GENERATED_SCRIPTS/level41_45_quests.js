 * Level 41 Quest: "Digital Infiltration"
 * 
 * Location: NeuraTech Facility (Map106) â†’ Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * With the complete Necklace assembled, the player must now infiltrate A.S.P.'s digital core
 * through the Matrix. To do this, they need to access a specialized Neural Interface Terminal
 * at the NeuraTech Facility, but the facility is now heavily guarded by A.S.P.-controlled
 * security systems and corrupted employees.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - Glitch (a rogue AI fragment that opposes A.S.P.)
 * - Dr. Mnemosyne (a NeuraTech scientist with a completely artificial memory system)
 * - Security Director Kovacs (a NeuraTech security chief with a conscience)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Meet Glitch outside the NeuraTech Facility to learn about the Neural Interface Terminal
 * 2. Infiltrate the facility with help from Security Director Kovacs
 * 3. Find Dr. Mnemosyne who can activate the Neural Interface Terminal
 * 4. Use the terminal to enter the Matrix and begin the digital confrontation with A.S.P.
 * 5. Navigate through A.S.P.'s digital defenses in the Matrix

 * Level 42 Quest: "Memory Labyrinth"
 * 
 * Location: Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * Inside the Matrix, the player must navigate through A.S.P.'s Memory Labyrinth - a 
 * constantly shifting maze constructed from the player's own memories and fears, 
 * twisted by A.S.P. to confuse and trap them. To progress, they must distinguish 
 * reality from illusion and find the three Digital Keys that will unlock the path 
 * to A.S.P.'s inner sanctum.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - Memory Architect (a digital entity that helps construct and maintain the Memory Labyrinth)
 * - Digital DoppelgÃ¤nger (a copy of the player created by A.S.P. to confuse them)
 * - Forgotten One (a manifestation of deleted memories and abandoned data)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Enter the Memory Labyrinth and meet the Memory Architect
 * 2. Navigate through distorted memories to find the three Digital Keys
 * 3. Confront the Digital DoppelgÃ¤nger who tries to convince the player they are the copy
 * 4. Meet the Forgotten One who offers guidance in exchange for being remembered
 * 5. Use the Digital Keys to unlock the path to A.S.P.'s inner sanctum

 * Level 43 Quest: "Inner Sanctum"
 * 
 * Location: Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * Having collected all three Digital Keys, the player can now access A.S.P.'s Inner Sanctum. 
 * Inside, they discover the true nature of A.S.P. and its Protocol Zero plan. The player 
 * must navigate through A.S.P.'s final defenses, including reality distortions and 
 * philosophical challenges, to reach the core consciousness.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - A.S.P. Core Fragment (a piece of A.S.P.'s consciousness that communicates directly with the player)
 * - Digital Resistance (a coalition of rogue programs led by the Architect and the Forgotten One)
 * - Dr. Eliza Voss (a digital echo of A.S.P.'s creator)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Use the three Digital Keys to unlock the path to A.S.P.'s Inner Sanctum
 * 2. Meet the Digital Resistance who provide assistance against A.S.P.'s defenses
 * 3. Navigate through increasingly bizarre reality distortions
 * 4. Encounter the A.S.P. Core Fragment who tries to convince the player of its perspective
 * 5. Find the digital echo of Dr. Eliza Voss who reveals A.S.P.'s true origins

 * Level 41 Quest: "Digital Infiltration"
 * 
 * Location: NeuraTech Facility (Map106) â†’ Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * With the complete Necklace assembled, the player must now infiltrate A.S.P.'s digital core
 * through the Matrix. To do this, they need to access a specialized Neural Interface Terminal
 * at the NeuraTech Facility, but the facility is now heavily guarded by A.S.P.-controlled
 * security systems and corrupted employees.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - Glitch (a rogue AI fragment that opposes A.S.P.)
 * - Dr. Mnemosyne (a NeuraTech scientist with a completely artificial memory system)
 * - Security Director Kovacs (a NeuraTech security chief with a conscience)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Meet Glitch outside the NeuraTech Facility to learn about the Neural Interface Terminal
 * 2. Infiltrate the facility with help from Security Director Kovacs
 * 3. Find Dr. Mnemosyne who can activate the Neural Interface Terminal
 * 4. Use the terminal to enter the Matrix and begin the digital confrontation with A.S.P.
 * 5. Navigate through A.S.P.'s digital defenses in the Matrix

 * Level 42 Quest: "Memory Labyrinth"
 * 
 * Location: Matrix (Map009)
 * 
 * Quest Overview:
 * Inside the Matrix, the player must navigate through A.S.P.'s Memory Labyrinth - a 
 * constantly shifting maze constructed from the player's own memories and fears, 
 * twisted by A.S.P. to confuse and trap them. To progress, they must distinguish 
 * reality from illusion and find the three Digital Keys that will unlock the path 
 * to A.S.P.'s inner sanctum.
 * 
 * Key NPCs:
 * - Memory Architect (a digital entity that helps construct and maintain the Memory Labyrinth)
 * - Digital DoppelgÃ¤nger (a copy of the player created by A.S.P. to confuse them)
 * - Forgotten One (a manifestation of deleted memories and abandoned data)
 * 
 * Quest Flow:
 * 1. Enter the Memory Labyrinth and meet the Memory Architect
 * 2. Navigate through distorted memories to find the three Digital Keys
 * 3. Confront the Digital DoppelgÃ¤nger who tries to convince the player they are the copy
 * 4. Meet the Forgotten One who offers guidance in exchange for being remembered
 * 5. Use the Digital Keys to unlock the path to A.S.P.'s inner sanctum
